# ai-spec-generator

A minimal starter template for building spec-driven AI projects. This repository
provides examples of specification files, prompt templates, and placeholder
scripts for generating resources from those specs.

## Usage
1. Place your YAML specifications in the `specs/` directory or copy the
   template from `templates/spec-template.yaml`.
2. Create or modify prompts in `prompts/` to guide your AI model.
3. Extend `scripts/generate_from_spec.py` with the logic required to process a
   spec and produce output. Examples of output can be kept under `examples/`.
4. Documentation goes in the `docs/` folder and tests belong in `tests/`.

This project is intentionally lightweight so you can adapt it to your own
workflow.
